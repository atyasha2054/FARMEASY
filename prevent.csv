,Property,Threshold Value (Typical Range),Organic Prevention Methods,Commercial Products,Remarks
0,pH,6.0 - 7.5,Use organic matter like compost to adjust pH levels.,Agricultural Lime: Increases pH (reduces acidity).,Most crops thrive in this range; below 6.0 can lead to nutrient deficiencies.
1,EC ,0.2 - 1.0,Apply gypsum or organic mulch to reduce salinity.,Gypsum: Helps to reduce soil salinity and improve structure.,"Values above 1.5 dS/m indicate salinity issues, affecting plant health."
2,OC ,20 - 50 ,"Add compost, green manures, or cover crops to increase organic carbon.",Humic Acid Products: Enhance soil structure and nutrient retention.,Higher organic carbon improves soil structure and fertility.
3,OM ,03-Jun,Use compost and organic fertilizers to enhance organic matter content.,Compost Tea: Provides nutrients and beneficial microbes.,Organic matter content should ideally be around 5% for healthy soil.
4,N ,20 - 40,Plant legumes and use compost to naturally enrich soil with nitrogen.,Urea: A common nitrogen fertilizer for crops.,Varies based on crop; higher levels are generally required for leafy vegetables.
5,P ,15 - 30,Utilize bone meal or rock phosphate as organic phosphorus sources.,Triple Super Phosphate (TSP): High phosphorus fertilizer.,Phosphorus deficiency can limit root development and flowering.
6,K ,100 - 200,Incorporate wood ash or greensand to supply potassium organically.,Potassium Chloride: Commonly used potassium fertilizer.,Essential for overall plant health; higher levels may be needed for fruiting crops.
7,Zn ,01-Mar,Apply zinc sulfate or use compost to ensure adequate zinc levels.,Zinc Sulfate: Corrects zinc deficiency in soil.,Critical for enzyme function; deficiency can lead to stunted growth.
8,Fe ,02-May,Use iron chelates or foliar sprays with iron to boost levels.,Iron Chelates: Supplies iron in a plant-available form.,Important for chlorophyll production; deficiency causes chlorosis.
9,Cu ,0.5 - 1.5,Use composted manure to provide copper naturally.,Copper Sulfate: Used to address copper deficiencies.,Micronutrient needed in small amounts; excess can be toxic.
10,Mn ,May-15,Incorporate organic matter and mulch to maintain manganese levels.,Manganese Sulfate: Provides manganese for plant uptake.,Important for photosynthesis; deficiency can lead to yellowing of leaves.
11,Sand,300 - 700 ,Add organic matter to improve soil structure and drainage.,Coarse Sand: Improves drainage and aeration in heavy soils.,Influences drainage; optimal ranges depend on specific crops.
12,Silt ,200 - 500 ,Improve with cover cropping to enhance silt content.,Silt Loam Amendments: Products designed to enhance silt content.,Improves nutrient retention; ideal for a loamy texture.
13,Clay ,100 - 300 ,Incorporate organic matter to improve aeration in clay soils.,Clay Soil Amendments: Improve drainage and structure.,Affects water retention; too much clay can lead to drainage issues.
14,CaCO3 ,0 - 15 ,Use organic amendments to lower calcium carbonate levels if excessive.,Sulfur: Helps to reduce high calcium carbonate content.,"High levels can raise soil pH, affecting nutrient availability."
15,CEC ,Oct-40,Regular addition of organic matter improves cation exchange capacity.,Potassium and Calcium Fertilizers: Improve CEC in sandy soils.,Higher values indicate better nutrient-holding capacity.
16,Temperature ,15 - 25,Use cover crops to moderate soil temperature fluctuations.,Thermal Blankets: Used in nurseries to stabilize soil temperature.,Influences growth; extremes can stress plants.
17,Humidity,40 - 70,Employ mulching and cover cropping to maintain moisture levels.,Moisture-retaining Mulch Products: Helps maintain soil moisture.,Excess humidity can lead to fungal issues; maintain optimal levels.
