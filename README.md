# **FarmEasy: Leveraging Earth Observation Data for Precision Agriculture**  

## **Overview**  
FarmEasy is a research-driven initiative that integrates **Earth Observation (EO) data and Machine Learning (ML) models** to enhance **agricultural decision-making**. This project is part of an academic research paper exploring the application of **remote sensing, AI-based analytics, and automated decision support systems** to optimize farming efficiency.  

## **Problem Statement**  
Traditional farming methods face several challenges, including:  
- **Inconsistent soil health assessment** leading to inefficient fertilization.  
- **Lack of real-time pest detection**, increasing crop loss.  
- **Water mismanagement** due to conventional irrigation techniques.  
- **Limited access to technological solutions** for small-scale farmers.  

FarmEasy aims to **bridge this gap** by providing **data-driven insights** for **sustainable and precision farming** using satellite imagery and AI-powered analytics.  

## **Proposed Solution**  
FarmEasy employs **remote sensing technologies and deep learning models** to provide the following solutions:  
- **Soil Health Analysis** â€“ Evaluates soil properties (pH, Nitrogen, Potassium, Phosphorus) for improved fertility management.  
- **Pest Monitoring** â€“ Uses **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to detect infestations through plant image analysis.  
- **Automated Irrigation Management** â€“ Optimizes water usage based on real-time soil conditions.  
- **Crop Yield Prediction** â€“ Utilizes EO data and ML models to forecast agricultural output.  

## **Key Features**  
âœ… **Data-Driven Decision Making** â€“ Integrates **satellite data, IoT sensors, and AI** for real-time agricultural analysis.  
âœ… **Sustainable Farming Practices** â€“ Reduces resource wastage and enhances productivity.  
âœ… **Scalable & Accessible** â€“ Designed for diverse crop types and adaptable to different geographical conditions.  

## **Technology Stack**  
- **EO Data Sources** â€“ NASA MODIS, SMAP, Sentinel-2, Landsat-8  
- **Machine Learning** â€“ TensorFlow, OpenCV, CNN models  
- **Data Processing & Visualization** â€“ Python, Plotly  
- **Cloud Integration** â€“ AWS for scalable data storage and computation  

## **Research Contribution**  
This project contributes to ongoing research in **precision agriculture**, **remote sensing applications in farming**, and **AI-driven crop monitoring**. The findings and methodologies explored in FarmEasy can potentially be extended to further studies on:  
- AI-driven crop disease diagnosis  
- Climate impact analysis on agriculture  
- Blockchain-based agricultural supply chain tracking
